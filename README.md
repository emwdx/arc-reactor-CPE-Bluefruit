# arc-reactor-CPE-Bluefruit
This is a CircuitPython powered Circuit Playground Express Bluefruit that changes flash color using the Bluefruit LE Connect app. A simpler version that does not change color is also in the directory.

The blue_pulse_only.py file is a slow, cyan flash that does not have the Bluetooth connection capability.

The code.py file has the Bluetooth color change feature. You can connect to the Circuit Playground Express Bluefruit using the Adafruit Bluefruit LE Connect app.
